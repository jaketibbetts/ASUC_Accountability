/V (1. Worked with Anthony‚Äôs Office on a bill about Student Regent involvement in future Chancellor Search Committees. 2. Council of Presidents Meeting 2a. Controversial Speakers of any Political Persuasion Response‚ÄîUCPD Council of Chiefs will be discussing use of non-lethal projectiles from firearms for protest dispersion. Recommended a fund established for alternative events in the event of future situations where the University spends an inordinate amount on security for a singular event. Idea for explicit wording in all future contracts with guest speakers/performers/groups that require the utilization of UCPD resources for security that they will agree to abide by all campus Title IX, anti-harassment, intimidation, doxxing policies, which students/faculty/staff would be expected to if they were to speak. 2c. Undocumented Student Protection‚ÄîUCOP Blue and Gold Cards to be distributed, as part of a Know Your Rights Campaign. COP expressed concern over the lack of formal delineation of ‚Äúsanctuary campus‚Äù but Pres. Napolitano reassured that all policies of the new principles are the same as if we were just without the name All this is important because ICE was spotted at UCR last week (even though campus or UCPD did not cooperate, they still were there). 2d. Best Practice Idea for SVSH from UCLA given 133 UC staff number just reported in Daily Cal‚ÄîAcademic policy that any student should not be in a position to take a class as being mandatory for a major/minor/prereq track fulfillment from an individual who settled or was punished for an SVSH incident. 4. ASUC Perspectives Showcase March 8th-12th, Headliner finalized, who has collaborated with Pharrell Williams, Usher, and has hundreds of thousands of followers on social media, and may be a guest speaker too. 5. I received very positive reception from VCUE Koshland about exchange program, taking next steps about exploring budget feasibility with Study Abroad Office. Have received support from many campus professors, inc. Arlie Hochschild (author of Strangers in their Own Land), Robert Reich)
