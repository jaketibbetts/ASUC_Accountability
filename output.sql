The purpose of the ASUC Tabling program is to strengthen the connection between students and their student government representatives on campus by fostering a culture of transparency of information. In addition, the tabling program should strengthen the internal culture of ASUC, encouraging ASUC elected officials and staff members to communicate and collaborate.

Controversial Speakers of any Political Persuasion Response—UCPD Council of Chiefs will be discussing use of non-lethal projectiles from firearms for protest dispersion. Recommended a fund established for alternative events in the event of future situations where the University spends an inordinate amount on security for a singular event. Idea for explicit wording in all future contracts with guest speakers/performers/groups that require the utilization of UCPD resources for security that they will agree to abide by all campus Title IX, anti-harassment, intimidation, doxxing policies, which students/faculty/staff would be expected to if they were to speak. 2c. Undocumented Student Protection—UCOP Blue and Gold Cards to be distributed, as part of a Know Your Rights Campaign. COP expressed concern over the lack of formal delineation of “sanctuary campus” but Pres. Napolitano reassured that all policies of the new principles are the same as if we were just without the name All this is important because ICE was spotted at UCR last week (even though campus or UCPD did not cooperate, they still were there). 2d.

The purpose of the ASUC Tabling program is to strengthen the connection between students and their student government representatives on campus by fostering a culture of transparency of information. In addition, the tabling program should strengthen the internal culture of ASUC, encouraging ASUC elected officials and staff members to communicate and collaborate. Tabling will continue throughout the semester.\r\n\r\nNew ASUC Website:\r\nI am working with a few other members of the ASUC on redesigning the ASUC website.

The purpose of the ASUC Tabling program is to strengthen the connection between students and their student government representatives on campus by fostering a culture of transparency of information. In addition, the tabling program should strengthen the internal culture of ASUC, encouraging ASUC elected officials and staff members to communicate and collaborate. Tabling will continue throughout the semester.\r\n\r\nNew ASUC Website:\r\nI am working with a few other members of the ASUC on redesigning the ASUC website.
